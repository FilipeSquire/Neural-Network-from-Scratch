# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
-----

This directory is dedicated for the study of the book Neural Networks from Scratch (https://nnfs.io/) in which the author proposes to explain, both by coding and mathematically, the functioning of a Neural Network from within.

There is also a youtube playlist create by this same author, although incomplete till now.

It can be found at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3

**The book goes over the following topics:**
1. Creating Neurons
2. Adding Layers
3. Creating Activation Functions
4. Calculating Error through Loss Functions
5. Optimizing - Derivatives
6. Optimizing - Gradient Descent, Partial Derivatives, Chain Rule
7. Backpropagation
8. Regulatization
9. Saving and Loading Models

# In development:
-----
Till now it has been documented all the code up to Optimizing classes of the book. 
There's left:

* Notebook with all optimizing classes
* Notebook with al regression classes
* Final notebook
* Final code (.py)
* .doc with mathematical explanation (Notion)
* .doc with Literature Review on Latests Advances in this topic (Notion)
